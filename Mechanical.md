# Goal
Our goal in creating the design of the hand was to make something that is easy to 3D-print, have ways to access and change internal components if needed.

# Final Product
Our final product

# Previous Iterations and Challenges
At the beginning of this project, our hand was simply a block with straight holes creating routes for the fishing line. This was for proof of concept and to see the project work without supports making an easier print.

</p>

Then we moved towards a more anatomical design, creating a rounded palm.

</p>

Next we elongated the palm to make the hand more realistic, and created a wrist portion that could friction fit onto our hand and enclose our hardware.

</p>

We also began creating our fingers. Here we included a separate piece for each part of the finger, along with caps at the top of the fingers so that we can easily access the strings controlling the fingers.

The next thing that we focussed on was making servo mounts inside the arm. We made mounts for 5 servo motors. A lot of iteration used friction fit!!!
