# Goal
Our goal in creating the design of the hand was to make something that is easy to 3D-print, have ways to access and change internal components if needed.

# Final Product
Our final product 

# Previous Iterations and Challenges
At the beginning of this project, our hand was simply a block with straight holes creating routes for the fishing line. This was for proof of concept and to see the project work without supports making an easier print.

Then we moved towards a more anatomical design, creating a rounded palm.

</p>

After that we decided to elongate the palm portion of the hand and focused on making fingers. Then we made finger caps. Then we made knuckles so the fingers donâ€™t flail around. Then we made the arm part, and then we made servo mounts, then we made mounts for all 5 servo motors. A lot of iteration used friction fit!!!
